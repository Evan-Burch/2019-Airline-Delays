# 2019-Airline-Delays

The problem is a binary classification evaluating a delayed departure. We will analyze whether a departure will be delayed based on various flight and airport information. The data comes from Kaggle at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/2019-airline-delays-and-cancellations/data. The dimensionality of the data is low/normal as there are only 26 attributes in full_data_flightdelay.csv. There are 20 numeric attributes, with only 4 categorical and 2 text attributes. The sparsity is low as there are almost no missing entries.
